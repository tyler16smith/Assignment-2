    <!-- Get out of IS -->
    <h3>What I hope to get out of IS 413</h3>
    <p>
        By the end of this semester, I hope to feel comfortable understanding, navigating, writing, and
        reading in the ASP.NET Core MVC framework. I also hope to strengthen my ability to learn
        something new and figure things out. A lot of what we learn in school is learning how to learn.
        During my internship this summer with Anglepoint, I will certainly be learning new tools, skills, and perhaps
        even programming languages. I want to provide as much value as I can to this company and the clients I will
        work with. Becoming familiar with ASP.NET Core MVC and learning how to learn will both prepare me for whatever
        career opportunities lie ahead.
